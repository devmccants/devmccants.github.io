# My ReadME file

I'm in the midst of learning C# and C++ to step into the wonderful world of software development. With the help of Microsoft Learn, I began working on a C# project. 

Here is my code: https://github.com/devmccants/devmccants.github.io/blob/main/GPAcalculator.cs

Summary of GPAcalculator: My goal was to build an application that takes course information for a student, calculates the overall GPA, and displays the results.

To accomplish this, I declared and assigned values to variables of different data types, performed numeric operations, and used type casting to achieve accurate results. I also used the WriteLine() method and character escape sequences to format the output.
